## Some things I believe:

- A mission that matters adds a +4 to will saves
- The best product strategy is the obvious one
- Product scope is a multiplier for all of your faults
- Data > Feelings
- Outcome-oriented > Process oriented
- Developer velocity == Business Value Created / Time
- High-performing teams are loosely coupled but tightly aligned
- An organization is a weighted graph of trust between individuals. The health of an organization is the sum of the edges.
- You only know who someone truly is when they are exhausted, thwarted, or stakes are high and nobody is looking.
