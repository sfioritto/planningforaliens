## Some things I believe:

- A mission that matters adds a +4 to will saves
- High performing teams are loosely coupled but tightly aligned
- An organization is a weighted graph of trust between individuals. The health of an organization is the sum of edges.
  - High performing teams require trust. Trust requires accountability.
  - Sociopaths, narcissists and bureaucrats thrive in the absence of accountability.
- You will find out who someone truly is when they are exhausted, thwarted, the stakes are high and nobody is looking.
  - In the military you can wake someone up in the middle of the night and send them rucking for 70 miles then make them count grains of rice when they get back. That's an interview.
  - This is hard to mimic in the private sector
- The best product strategy is the obvious one
- Outcome oriented > Project oriented
  - Data > Feelings
  - Teams that aren't outcome oriented select for political skills
  - If you're not outcome oriented then you're pleasing internal stakeholders, not building products
- Developer velocity == business value created over time.
  - You increase velocity by decreasing time to feedback; faster test suites, compile time, UI updates, customers feedback and KPIs
