# What I'm Doing Now

## Day Job

Director of Product Engineering for [FORGE](http://www.sofwarellc.com). We expanded to two new customers recently and I feel like we're on the cusp of more repeatable growth. I still love this job!

## My Mission

I went to a retreat a couple weeks ago to reflect on my career with some close friends. In the process of preparing for that time I discovered why I like my job so much: it's because I'm on a mission.

Our most important institutions and companies are unbelievably bad at deciding who gets power and I’m on mission to fix it.

## Positronic

I'm having a blast working on [Positronic](https://github.com/sfioritto/positronic). Positronic is a framework for building LLM powered automations driven by a CLI. Right now I'm using it to:

* Present the low value emails in my inboxes in a UI that lets me process them super quickly e.g. it plucks action items from the millions, perhaps billions of daily emails that my children's schools generate for me. One click archiving of all marketing emails, view bills and receipts on one page, etc.
* Summarize the work my team has been doing all week per dev and slack me
* Automatically match receipts with expenses in Mercury
* Scan often for emails that need my attention immediately
* Build a Hacker News digest that's tailored for me

Mainly I use it as an excuse to avoid developer rust and hone my skills using coding agents, (Claude Code all day every day), as I'm not programming as much at work these days.

## Spyglasses

I stopped working on it, switched to Positronic. I guess I should update the [graveyard](/graveyard)

## Generative UI

I think that [AI will compress time on UI improvements to zero](/ideas/ai-will-compress-time-on-ui-improvements-to-zero). This is still on my mind, and [Positronic](https://github.com/sfioritto/positronic) even has a rough generative UI tool that a Positronic brain can use as a tool, but I don't think I'm going to build a business around it.

## Beth, Ada and Isaac!

Isaac's in 6th grade now (middle school!), Ada is walking and talking and started at a new Montessori Preschool. Beth finds herself back in education as a special education assistant and is seriously considering a teaching comeback. Isaac and I took up backpacking! We did our first excursion in the Pacific Northwest and I'm trying to plan more hikes for us this year.
