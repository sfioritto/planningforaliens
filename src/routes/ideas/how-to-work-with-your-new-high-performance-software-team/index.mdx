If you have never worked with a COTS software team before this guide was written to quickly get you up to speed on how to get the most out of our working relationship. If you have worked with a different COTS software team we still recommend reading this guide as we find that our processes are often surprisingly different than other teams.

## What makes software projects so hard?

The default result of a software project is failure.

- 66% of software technology projects end in partial or total failure.
- Large projects are successful less than 10% of the time. Even the smallest software projects fail one in ten times.
- 31% of US IT projects are canceled outright
- 17% of large IT projects go so badly, they threaten the very existence of the company.
- 70% of "digital transformation efforts" fall short of meeting targets.

Software is never finished. There are always more things to work on then you have money for. It can always be better. You have to manage stakeholders. You have to know when to say no.
