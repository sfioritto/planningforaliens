# Immediate Impacts of GPT-4

## Developer Productivity
* Customized how-to's for every new topic
* Faster throughput on simple debugging
	From `Error Message —> Google —> Stack Overflow/Github Issues —> Code Change` to `Error Message —> Fix with AI`
* Huge throughput increases in languages and platforms developers are less fluent in
* Autocomplete for whole functions
* Solve the blank page problem
* Overall improved ergonomics for retrieving information leads to fewer interruptions and more flow state
## Every product can add Google-level semantic search
With not but an API call and the use of `pgvector` developers can add powerful semantic search and topic clustering features to any product.
## World class zero-shot classification
Before GPT-4 classification was a separate problem to be solved but classification is an emergent property of 3.5 and 4 so instead of spinning up a separate model developers can make a simple API call.
## Chat interfaces that work
Not every UI should be replaced with Chat but many interactions with apps would be improved with a UI that is essentially “just tell me in plain English what you want to do”.

In the future, I expect to see Generative UI — so the model generates a UI instead of English. I expect this to replace a huge chunk of UI code. Why build a UI when you can just build an API, teach your model about it and have it generate UI on the fly for users?
