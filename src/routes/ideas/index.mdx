## About these notes

(These notes are inspired by [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes))

I've been toying around with the Zettelkasten method and trying to build a habit of deep thinking first thing in the morning. Everything here is a work in progress &mdash; consider it thinking out loud. The goal is to capture one, complete thought per note with lots of links to other thoughts.

One problem with this is it's not a blog so there is no index. I'll try to link to a few chains of thought here and you can follow the links.

I'm currently thinking a lot about Generative UI which is the moment when [Every user gets their own UI](/notes/every-user-gets-their-own-ui) generated by AI. [Generative UI will come in phases](/notes/generative-ui-will-come-in-phases).

I feel confident that this is the future of frontend development because the economic incentives are huge and the technology is already here. [AI will compress time on UI improvements to zero](/notes/ai-will-compress-time-on-ui-improvements-to-zero).
