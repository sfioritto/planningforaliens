# About these notes

(These notes are inspired by [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes))

I use these notes to capture ideas, thoughts, and things I'm learning. I'm not sure if they're useful to anyone else, but I'm happy to share them.

I'm currently thinking a lot about Generative UI, which is the moment when [Every user gets their own UI](every-user-gets-their-own-ui) generated by AI. [Generative UI will come in phases](generative-ui-will-come-in-phases).
