# Build Consensus

In my experience, building consensus is one of the three most important things a product manager does. The other two are creating a [Product Strategy](/ideas/product-strategy) and discerning between what's a [Laundromat or a Startup](/ideas/laundromat-or-a-startup).

My process for building consensus is roughly:

* I talk with all of the users and stakeholders and discover problems that the product team could solve.
* I run those problems through the product strategy filter, often change the strategy in the process, and then update the product roadmap.
* Along the way, I deliberately spike conversations between people and highlight key pieces of data to flatten everyone's understanding and reduce information silos.

 I actively search for and build consensus.
