Last year the Latent Space podcast coined the term [AI Engineer](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer). As LLM or LLM-like capabilities are created by the big AI labs, innovative product opportunities increase. Nat Friedman calls the gap between what we could do and what we've done so far the [capability overhang](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1636769905671544832?lang=en). AI Engineers are the people creating the tools and systems to fill in this overhang.

I'm interested in learning about AI Engineering because I want to add this cool shit to things that I'm working on. Plus anyone with a brain can see that this will be an enormous growth sector in tech for both jobs and startups with loads of interesting opportunities for those who manage to catch the wave.

I've spent the last year steeping my brain in anything and everything I could get my hands on about the topic. Podcasts. Blogs. YouTube channels. I've been throwing anything and everything into my feed.

The other day a buddy asked me for what I listen to/read on the topic. I haven't done a great job of keeping track of useful resources so I'm sure I'll remember things I forgot that I'll add in later and I'll keep it up to date as I find stuff worth your time.
