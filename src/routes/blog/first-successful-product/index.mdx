The plan was to land a quiet, easy day job and work on building a software business until I was making enough on the side to quit. But after five years, the plan was clearly not working. I was experiencing total boredom during the day, taking customer development phone calls at lunch, and grinding away at code at night &mdash; my passion and enthusiasm dried up quickly when nobody cared about what I was doing.

The day-job-pays-for-side-projects plan failed. So I quit my job.


An education in entrepreneurship
--------------------

My new plan was to treat the next year like I was working on a
graduate degree for entrepreneurship. So I read <a href="http://www.startupbook.net/">books</a> and
<a href="http://30x500.com/">took classes</a> and <a
href="https://twitter.com/amyhoy">found</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/studiofellow">mentors</a>.

The rest of my story and how I grew my email list to over 3,000 people and made over $15,000 is really just me
executing what I learned from these smart, successful business owners to the best of my ability.

Lesson #1: Choose your customers carefully
------------------------------

You should start with customers, not a product.

 If you start with people, invest time in understanding the daily
 aches and pains of their lives, and you actually create a decent
 product to solve those problems, you will make money. Itâ€™s almost guaranteed.

So it follows if step one is to understand your customers, you should
pick the customers that you want.

I decided I wanted my customers to have money and be inclined to spend it. They
should also be working on things I'm interested in, so I don't get too
bored making stuff for them later. (It does get boring fast. Just
trust me on this.) They should also hang out on the web, because otherwise I
would have no idea how to reach them.

There are other qualifications, but these are the
most important.

In retrospect, I should have picked web developers or Python
developers or Javascript developers &mdash; all things that I am. But I
picked web designers, and I am not a web designer. Oops.

It's easier to relate to people when you've already been in their
shoes. It's easier to market to them, easier to understand their
problems, and easier to identify pains big enough for you to
solve and charge money for.

Lesson #2: Have some empathy for your customers
------------------------------

The next step is to really understand your customers and what they
struggle with every day. Look for pain, anguish, guilt, and
frustration. Take that pain away...and make $$$.

Don't do customer interviews. I used to do
these, but people lie (usually to be nice). Instead, go read what they say on the sites
where they hang out. The results will be more truthful.

I read hundreds, probably thousands, of articles and forum threads
until I discovered some patterns. Here is
<a href="http://www.sazzy.co.uk/2012/02/why-i-cant-design-in-the-browser/comment-page-1/">one example</a>
of many articles I found filled with really frustrated people. I
wanted to help them!

(P.S. If you want to build a repeatable
process for finding business opportunities over and over again, and
who doesn't, I recommend starting with <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2013/how-do-you-create-a-product-people-want-to-buy">this little essay by Amy Hoy</a>. Good stuff.)


Sketching with CSS is born
------------------------------

You don't have to write software to solve someone's problem. There are
other kinds of
products. <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/">Sketching with CSS</a> is a
book/video/info product. Software is what I do, so it felt weird to me
to start a company and not write software. But given all
my past failures, I wanted to do something small that I
could finish quickly.

Once I decided on my customers (web designers), their pain (the
frustrations of designing in the browser), and a solution
(an ebook with videos), I created a landing page and started growing
my email list.

Lesson #3: Turns out entrepreneurship is a grind
------------------------------

I put my new landing page on the web_design subreddit, and I got 15
email addresses. Four of them might have been my mom using fake email
addresses to make me feel better. Ouch.

I'm much better at
growing my list now, but there is still never a magic moment
when everything becomes easy. I'll spend a day writing a blog post
like this and usually net a couple hundred email addresses. It's
better than 15, but man, would my life be better if it was 10,000. I've
given up on that ever happening, though. As it turns out, entrepreneurship is a grind.

I now have over 3,000 people on my mailing list, a far cry
from 15. How did I do it?

This is where all the research I did paid off. First, I
uncovered many great blog post ideas as I was reading articles and
comment threads, so I have a pretty big list of ideas. Also as a
result of my research, I know where web designers spend time. All I
do is pick a topic from my list, write a really good blog post, and
then share it in all the places where I know my customers will be.

I also put an email signup form at the bottom of every post.

Write a blog post, and promote it everywhere. I did that over and over and over and over again.

A few tactics for growing your list
------------------------------

* You don't have to write blog posts if you don't want to. The most successful thing I did
for growing my mailing list was the
<a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/samplechapter/cheatsheet.html">Ultimate Flexbox Cheat Sheet</a>.

* Give away a chapter. I
<a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/samplechapter/cheatsheet.html">did that</a>
and snagged 500 email addresses.

* Write guest posts. I wrote
<a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/18/the-future-of-video-in-web-design/">one big guest post</a>
for Smashing Magazine, and it resulted in another 500 email
addresses. I plan to guest post more this year.

* Add a sweetener. Give something away for free in exchange for an email
address. I give away an <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/flexbox/">interactive video course all about
flexbox</a>. People love the course, and the email forms convert
well. I use Nathan Barry's <a href="https://convertkit.com/">ConvertKit</a> to
deliver the course and then move those emails over to MailChimp from time
to time.

Lesson #4: Start small ... then go even smaller.
------------------------------

I underestimated the amount of work it would take to write a book and
create hours of screencasts, all while writing blog posts to grow my
email list. I am not a fast writer. If you can crank out a blog post
in an hour or two instead of the day it takes me, you will finish
much more quickly than I did.

I wrote and promoted for 6 months, which is a far cry from, say, Nathan Barry's
usual turnaround time of 3 months. Structuring and prioritizing your
time are skills, and apparently years of corporate dronehood had
atrophied these particular skills for me. Plus, did I mention that I'm slow at writing?

But my excuses don't matter. Instead, the takeaway for you
should be to start with an even smaller project than <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/">Sketching with
CSS</a>. Maybe you are good at structuring and prioritizing your time, but
chances are you will run into another skill bottleneck.

Product scope is like a multiplier for all of your faults, so pick something small.

Lesson #5: Launching is an art form
------------------------------

There is an art to launching a product, and I do not have
it. Fortunately, it is a skill that can be learned, and I am learning.
If you haven't launched a product before, you are probably also bad at
launches. This is all the more reason to make a small product.

I launched <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/">Sketching with CSS</a>
twice. For the first launch, I announced pre-orders to a list of
about 1,000. The second launch happened when the book was finished, and I
launched to 3,111 people.

On the first launch, I made about $5,000 in two days. Since the second
launch was to a list three times as big, I expected to make about
twice as much (factoring in that some people on the list had already
pre-ordered). Instead, I only made another $5,000. I had clearly messed up my
launch.

After chatting with Amy Hoy on Skype about it, I learned that I had
failed to build anticipation for the product. For the second launch, I
sent five emails over the course of five days. The emails were
essentially no different than my blog posts. They were useful and
on topics relevant to my audience. My email list loved them. But the
problem was that I failed to tie the emails back to my product. I barely
mentioned Sketching with CSS until the last email, so I failed to
build anticipation. Oops.

Fortunately, I can launch again. I'll fix it the next time around.

Lesson #6: You probably don't know what you are doing
------------------------------

My launch failure highlights one important lesson I've
learned: Entrepreneurship is a skill. If you've never left the "build
cool product" phase of building a business, then you don't have entrepreneurial skills. This
is why I think it's crazy to start off with a huge software product
that takes months to create, especially if you don't know your
customers yet.

Launching is a skill. Promotion is a skill. Writing for your audience
is a skill. Learning about your customers is a skill. Empathy is a
skill. Structuring and prioritizing your time are skills.

You're probably not great at all these skills. Start small, so
you can learn as you grow your business.

One more thing: charge more
------------------------------

You should charge for the value of your product. For example, my price points
are $39, $99, and $249. A $7 ebook is a legit way to make money and build
an audience, but if you're in it to learn, you'll learn more if you
charge based on value.

Let me explain. It takes guts to charge $249 for an info product. And because
it's so scary, unless you are a fool, you will absolutely do your research
and make something worth the price. For me,
the price forced me to know my customers' pains inside and
out.

There's yet another lesson to learn from charging more. Even when you
know it's worth it, even when you know your customers inside and out, it's still scary
to charge real money for your product. You have to learn how to get
over it. Don't avoid it, don't be a wimp, and charge real
money. Charge for the actual value of your product, and don't undersell
yourself.

You may be thinking asking for money for something is no big deal,
piece of cake, not scary at all &mdash; talk to me when you've
actually done it.

Oh, and the more you charge, the better your customers will be. I love my customers.

Onward and upward
------------------------------

Since I've started charging for a product I'm selling on the internet,
I've been making about $4,000 a month. Not bad! But not good enough,
either.

If I can pull this off even after screwing up two launches, picking
too big of a first product, and choosing an audience I have a hard time
relating to, you can do it, too.
