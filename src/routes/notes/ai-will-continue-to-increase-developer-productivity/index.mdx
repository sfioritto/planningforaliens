# AI will continue to increase developer productivity

* Less time writing tests because you will use AI-generated, self-healing tests
*  Less boilerplate because of generated code
* Almost no time spent on UI code as it's generated directly from designs and eventually on demand for a user as [Every user gets their own UI](/notes/every-user-gets-their-own-ui)
* Faster bug fixing as AI solves most bugs with a “Solve with AI” button
* Decreased learning curve because you'll have an AI tutor for every stack you work with and an AI can answer questions about a new code base
* Improved code base quality as AI does continuous static analysis above and beyond what linters give us today
* Less and less developer time spent writing and maintaining code at some point reaching 0
