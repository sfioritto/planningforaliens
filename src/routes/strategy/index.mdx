# Strategy


## I want to…

1. _Cash. In._
2. Elevate my status
3. Be a part of the wave
4. Work with excellent, competitive people on an exciting, challenging problem that matters


## My constraints are …

1. Time
2. Energy
3. Credentials
4. Network
5. Money

### Time and Energy

I'm not going to work more than the 50-60 hours I work now because then it becomes impossible for me to spend time with my family and on my health. I also require vacations to manage my energy. I think the balance I have now is optimal for both time and energy. Ada is a big energy suck right now because of her lack of sleeping, which will not last forever but is a meaningful constraint for the moment.

### Credentials

It seems as if credentials like a Master's Degree in AI from Stanford or a successful open-source project make it significantly easier to get your seed and series A investment rounds. It's almost as if you get to cash them in for spins at the startup roulette wheel. Working with Navy SEALs is certainly a ✅ in the credentials column but the reality is the story of my career arc so far doesn't scream “successful founder” in any of the stereotypical ways. My story lines up perfectly with a product leadership position in a small to mid-sized SaaS doing a boring but high-margin business. I could also be a Tiny Seed/Calm Fund founder. These options don't fulfill my "want" list.

### Network

I do not have people kicking down the door for the opportunity to work with me. My network exists but it's weak because of the years of bootstrapping and working for/with smaller companies, I was a lazy bum at McMaster and any work I did on my personal brand was targeting shit I don't want to work on anymore (e.g. Sketching with CSS).

### Money

I can't fund myself. If I quit my job today I'd need to have some steady consulting gig lined up that pays my bills including health insurance. If I have no cash flow to cover our bills then that is an automatic big step backwards financially for me and Beth and that's a red line I won't cross.

## How I will win

**1. Target a seed round**

 This means not actively searching for a job. The steps I need to take to accomplish this will also open up job opportunities and I will evaluate those as they come up. Most seed rounds require some evidence of traction which leaves the bootstrapping option on the table. Targeting a seed round and not actively searching for a job or limiting myself to business models and markets that a bootstrapper could enter has a lot of upside and not a lot of downside.

**2. Punt on working on a problem that matters, but don't sell your soul.**

If you luck into it, great, otherwise realize that you have already had the opportunity to work on something that matters. Now it's time to cash in. Hitting all of your other wants will empower you to work on something that matters again in the future.

**3. Research and work in public.**

You need to fully utilize your limited spare time. Working in public lets you make progress while also increasing your luck surface area. Keep your research to a theme and rework your personal branding to reflect that theme. And the search for a business problem shouldn't be random. It should be constrained by what skills, knowledge and experience you have, and directed by the data you collect through research.

**4. Lean into clever, impressive and flashy**

Right now using AI in most workflows is aspirational. It's okay to build a luxury watch that lets you dive to 1500m even though _zero_ watch owners would do that because it's cool. Build excitement, signal that you are credible and stay loosely coupled to a possible business model. Avoid being seen as the devrel guy and don't become an educator.

**5. Always pay yourself**

Never put your finances at risk. Always prioritize paying the bills and saving for your future first. That means if you're fired from SOFware before you have funding or some other form of cash flow lined up then you completely reprioritize your energy to deal with the short-term problem of paying yourself. You're not quitting a job without significant funding and/or existing revenues to keep your personal finances covered.

**6. Be opportunistic**

Always take opportunities that collapse the search space e.g. Yes, take the interview with Apple. Go to dinner with Nathan Barry and Ryan Delk this time. Take speaking opportunities at the right conferences. A Job, Bootstrapped company or VC-backed company — whichever choice equals the largest payday with the least amount of variance and the biggest status increase. I'm not ideological about this anymore. I'm not afraid of dealing with managers, investors or boards. Everything is on the table.


## Feelings

I'm feeling confident and caffeinated as I write this. Curious what a less optimal mindset version of me will think of this later.

**Update:** Under-caffeinated, afternoon me reporting in.

I feel exhausted looking at what's required to get from here to there and anxious about all of the uncertainty. I think the problem with a strategy like this is it's out there in the future. The future, for me at least, oscillates between exciting and scary, weighted towards scary, depending on my mood. And when I feel exhausted and scared I tend to be drawn to the “just get a job that you can coast at and play around with stuff on the side” plan.

What's wrong with finding a middle manager job at some stable, boring company and working my way up from the inside while also getting a fat paycheck? Well, exactly _nothing_ is wrong with that. Except when I ask myself, “If you were financially independent, would you still do that?” And the answer is: "Yes, but only if I'm fulfilling all of my wants."

The fear here is about boundaries and my inability to have healthy boundaries in the past so my brain reasonably extracts to a future where:

* I work with terrible people
* I put my financial future at risk
* I work back to back to back fear-fueled 80-hour weeks
* I fail and am un-hirable

I'll make this promise to myself: I won't be a dick to myself. I won't put my financial future at risk or put in any grueling, fear-fueled hours. Of course you can't avoid all terrible people but to the extent that I can I'll fire them, and if I can't, I'll have boundaries and if they turn into someone like ~**redacted**~ and I can't beat them at their game then I'll just have to take the hit. Shit happens. But I know that I won't be financially ruined because I'm not going to put that at risk ever. I won't be un-hirable. Other than an AI future that completely replaces all humans I'd have to be asleep at the career wheel to end up un-hirable at this point.

## Why do I want what I want

Why do I want these things? I want these things for me because I deserve them.  But why do I want status and money? And why do I want to be a part of a “wave”?

If I say to someone, “I want to work with excellent, competitive people on an exciting, challenging problem that matters” that's uncontroversial. Not everyone would want that but most people wouldn't judge me negatively if they heard me say that. But if I say "I want status and money" there's a little guy even inside _my_ head that says “Ick. That's gross”.

I think that little guy is wrong.

### Let's tackle status first.

Previously I would have said I don't care about status. I generally don't like people with a higher status than me, not because they are higher status, but because they are dicks. In the past, I've turned down opportunities to increase my status because if you interact with high-status people and they make you feel like a smudge of dirt on the wall then, of course, if this happens enough times you conclude that a humble life of low status is the only true and good life and pursuing status is gross. But that's an ideology and a dumb one at that, (and one that I held previously). It's simply the opposite of soulless status-seeking. It's like when you disagree with how your parents raised you so you just do the opposite — that never works out because there's nothing good at either end! And it's not necessarily about finding balance and only seeking the “right” amount of status. I think it's about intent.

Status is not something my ego needs or even wants but the truth is that with more status and money I have more opportunities to work on interesting, important problems. Getting medium-rich selling widgets that track spools of industrial materials to more efficiently manage inventory does not also end up with me bumping elbows with movers and shakers. I want future me bumping elbows with movers and shakers even if I don't like any of them.

Status unlocks opportunities.

### Now money on the other hand? I care about that shit.

There is a hole in my psyche that wants me to shove money in it and I'm inclined to oblige because I think I can fill it.

There's a threshold of money past which you no longer have to think about money, some people call it “financial independence”; awesome people call it “fuck you money”.

I know people with FU money who still can't stop worrying about money. I'm confident I'm not one of these people. I don't have FU money but I have more money than I've ever had before and whenever I'm stressed or anxious about making money I can load up my accounts, look at the balances and I always breathe a little sigh of relief. The money in those accounts equals time for me to figure out and solve whatever calamity I'm worried about at the moment. I want to _cash in_ because I've worked my ass off and made many choices in my life that were ideologically opposed to cashing in so I don't have FU money yet. I'm done with that, I want mine, I want the FU money so I can breathe a sigh of relief and then get to work on shit that matters without the constraint of “must make money” looming over me.

Living a life seeking out status or money because it fills a hole somewhere in your psyche that you are not even aware of is a mindless life. It's the kind of life that spews out pain and suffering in all directions without even realizing it. My life is not mindless so I feel confident in my choice to pursue money and status.

I'm also aware that these are things that are outside of my control. I can point myself in the direction of money and status but it could never materialize or I could get it and then it disappears. My self-worth isn't tied to either of these things so I'm not worried about it, money and status are tools, nothing else. Though seriously fuck being poor again, I'm gonna try quite hard to not go there.

### Riding the wave

In the past, I think I used to turn my nose up at the current wave. I was being ideological.

"You should do everything from first principles, jumping on trendy waves of techno enthusiasm is foolishness! It will inevitably crash and what we have right now is already great if only people would be calm."

But I want to be a part of the wave this time. I don't like being a part of the stodgy, dying Rails, SaaS camp. I want to go where the energy is. I also know that it's easier to grow a business when you catch a wave. It's probably easier to grow a career too. And I'm not so foolish as to find myself in financial ruin because the wave I was riding was just the initial hype phase. I know how it works. I know how to save money and preserve my skills.
