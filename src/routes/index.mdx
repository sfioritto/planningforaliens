# Sean Fioritto

I'm a developer, leader and entrepreneur.

Some things about me:

- Grew up in Mesa, Arizona. I live in Chicago.
- On the internet since the 90's.
- Computer Science and Entreprenuership at UofA.
- Created my first web application in 2005 with the first release of Ruby on Rails.
- I wrote a book, [Sketching with CSS](https://www.sketchingwithcss.com), and it paid my bills for two years.
- Previously worked at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com), [McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.com), [Planning for Aliens](/).
- Currently Director of Product Engineering at [SOFware LLC](http://www.sofwarellc.com) &mdash; talent management for elite military units.

Some things I believe:

- A mission that matters adds a +4 to will saves
- Your organization's hidden hierarchy is a weighted graph of trust between individuals
  - The health of an organization is the sum of trust between its members
  - High performing teams require trust. Trust requires accountability.
  - Sociopaths, narcissists and mundane bureaucrats thrive in the absence of accountability.
- You don't find out who someone truly is until they are exhausted, thwarted, the stakes are high and nobody is looking.
  - In the military you can wake someone up in the middle of the night and send them rucking for 70 miles then make them count grains of rice when they get back. That's an interview.
  - This is hard to mimic in the private sector
- Skills matter but after requirements are met character matters more
  - Highly skilled people with low character ruin teams
- The best product strategy is the obvious one
  - Finding the obvious strategy is simple but not easy
- Outcome oriented > project oriented
  - Data > Feelings
  - Teams that aren't outcome oriented promote politicians
- Product managers determine how much time to spend on a feature
  - The solution space is infinite. Developers can take up as much or as little time as you want
  - If your team can't do this then you're probably pleasing internal stakeholders, not building products
